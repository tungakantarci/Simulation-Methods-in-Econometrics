1. Some of the exercises make use of the external function contained in the "exercise function" folder.
2. MATLAB is the choice of programming language because the syntax is clean and intutive and hence superior to all alternatives.
3. The exercises require knowledge of programing in MATLAB. To address this, I created a MATLAB workshop which can be found under the "Teaching" folder.
4. More simulation exercises on bootsrap methods, Monte Carlo integration, methods of quasi-random number generation, maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and indirect inference are to appear soon.
