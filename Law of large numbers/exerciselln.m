% Empirical exercise - Understanding the LLN using coin toss simulation

% 1. Aim of the exercise
% Understanding the law of large numbers using coin toss simulation. 

% 2. Convergence of the sample mean of coin tosses to the population mean

%% 2.1. Clear the memory
clear;

% 2.2. Set the number of tosses
N_tosses = 15000; % What would happen if you increase this number? 

% 2.3. Create a sequence of tosses
sequence_of_tosses = randi([0,1],[N_tosses,1]); % The same sequence has to be used throughout the exercise. 

% 2.4. Create the sequence of sample means of cumulating tosses in the sequence of tosses
mean_sample = NaN(N_tosses,1); % Create an empty matrix for storing the sequence of sample means of cumulating tosses in the sequence of tosses

for i = 1:N_tosses
    mean_sample(i,1) = mean(sequence_of_tosses(1:i,1));
end

% 2.5. Define the population mean
mean_population = 0.5; 

% 2.6. Plot the sample mean and the population mean against the number of tosses
scatter(1:N_tosses,mean_sample,0.001,'Marker','.')
ylim([0 1]) % Set the range of y axis. 
hold on

%% 2.7. Define the absolute difference and the tolerance parameter
abs_dif = abs(mean_sample-mean_population);
e = 0.01;

% 2.8. Create an indicator of whether the absolute difference is smaller than the tolerance parameter
abs_dif_smaller_than_e_dummy = abs_dif < e;

%% 3. Convergence of the sample mean of coin tosses to the population mean in probability

% 3.1. Create an empty matrix for storing probabilities
prob_of_abs_dif_smaller_than_e = NaN(N_tosses,1);

% 3.2. Probability that the absolute difference is larger than the tolerance parameter in samples of cumulating tosses in the sequence of tosses
for i = 1:N_tosses
    prob_of_abs_dif_smaller_than_e(i,1) = mean(abs_dif_smaller_than_e_dummy(1:i,1)); 
end

% 3.3. Plot the probability that the absolute difference is larger than the tolerance parameter against the number of tosses
