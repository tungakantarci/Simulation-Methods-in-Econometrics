1. MATLAB stands out as the programming language of choice due to its clean and intuitive syntax, which is superior to all alternatives. For example, the syntax and user interface of R or Python cannot match the simplicity and elegance of MATLAB. This quality makes MATLAB particularly well-suited for educational purposes, aligning seamlessly with the pedagogical approach underlying all the exercises presented on this page.
2. The exercises require knowledge of programming in MATLAB. To support this, a MATLAB workshop has been created and is available in the 'Teaching' repository. The workshop is self-contained, assumes no prior knowledge of MATLAB, and progresses to advanced programming concepts.
3. Some of the exercises presented on this page make use of the external function contained in the "exercise function" folder.
4. More exercises on bootsrap methods, Monte Carlo integration, methods of quasi-random number generation, maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and indirect inference are work in progress and will appear on this page in 2025.
