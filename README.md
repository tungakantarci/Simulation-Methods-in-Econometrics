1. MATLAB stands out as the programming language of choice due to its clean and intuitive syntax, and its excellent UI, which are superior to all alternatives. R or Python, for example, do not match the simplicity and elegance of MATLAB. These qualities make MATLAB particularly well-suited for educational purposes, aligning seamlessly with the pedagogical approach underlying all the exercises presented on this page.
2. The MATLAB code of a simulation exercise is explained in a PDF file. A firm understanding of the MATLAB code, however, requires knowledge of programming in MATLAB. To support this, a MATLAB workshop has been created and is available in the 'Teaching' repository. The workshop is self-contained, assumes no prior knowledge of MATLAB, and progresses to advanced programming concepts.
3. Some of the exercises presented on this page make use of the MATLAB function in the "exercise function" folder.
4. The .m files make use of MATLAB toolboxes. The utilized toolbozxes are mentioned in the PDF files.  
5. To download the .m and PDF files, first click on a file and then click on the download button at the upper-right panel of the page.
6. More exercises on bootsrap methods, Monte Carlo integration, methods of quasi-random number generation, maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and indirect inference are work in progress and will appear on this page in 2025.
