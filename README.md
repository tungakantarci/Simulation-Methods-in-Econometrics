1. MATLAB stands out as the programming language of choice due to its clean and intuitive syntax, and its excellent UI, which are superior to all alternatives. R or Python, for example, cannot match the simplicity and elegance of MATLAB. These qualities make MATLAB particularly well-suited for educational purposes, aligning seamlessly with the pedagogical approach underlying all the exercises presented on this page.
2. The exercises require knowledge of programming in MATLAB. To support this, a MATLAB workshop has been created and is available in the 'Teaching' repository. The workshop is self-contained, assumes no prior knowledge of MATLAB, and progresses to advanced programming concepts.
3. Some of the exercises presented on this page make use of the external function contained in the "exercise function" folder.
4. The MATLAB m files and the associated PDF files can be downloaded using the download button at the upper-right panel of an exercise page. 
5. More exercises on bootsrap methods, Monte Carlo integration, methods of quasi-random number generation, maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and indirect inference are work in progress and will appear on this page in 2025.
