% Empirical exercise - Understanding the LLN using coin toss simulation

%% 1. Aim of the exercise
% Understanding the law of large numbers using coin toss simulation. 

%% 2. Theory
% Refer to the accompanying PDF file for the theory.

%% 3. Convergence of the sample mean of coin tosses to the population mean

% 3.1. Clear the memory
clear;

% 3.2. Set the number of tosses
N_tosses = 25000; % What would happen if you increase this number? 

% 3.3. Create a sequence of tosses
sequence_of_tosses = random('Binomial',1,0.5,[N_tosses,1]);

% 3.4. Preallocate a matrix
mean_sample = NaN(N_tosses,1); 

% 3.5. Create the sequence of sample means
for i = 1:N_tosses
    mean_sample(i,1) = mean(sequence_of_tosses(1:i,1));
end

% 3.6. Define the population mean
mean_population = 0.5; 

% 3.7. Plot the sample mean and the population mean against the number 
% of tosses

scatter(1:N_tosses,mean_sample,0.001,'Marker','.')

%% 4. Indicator of whether the absolute difference is small enough

% 4.1. Define the absolute difference and the tolerance parameter
abs_dif = abs(mean_sample-mean_population);
e = 0.01;

% 4.2. Create the indicator
abs_dif_smaller_than_e_dummy = abs_dif < e;

% 4.3. Plot the indicator against the number of tosses

%% 5. Convergence of the sample mean to the population mean in probability

% 5.1. Preallocate the matrix for storing probabilities
prob_of_abs_dif_smaller_than_e = NaN(N_tosses,1);

% 5.2. Probability that the absolute difference is small enough
for i = 1:N_tosses
    prob_of_abs_dif_smaller_than_e(i,1) = mean( ...
